# express-rest-api 
A simple ExpressJS app with a REST API endpoint that fetches a list of users from the json file.
 Also, it allows the one to fetch a specific user from the JSON file.
 
 ### Getting started
 
 First things first, you'll need to fork or clone this repository, and run the install command of your choosing:
 
 ```
 yarn install
 
 // or
 
 npm install
 ```
To fire up the server, you'll need to start it with the start command:
 
 ```
 yarn start
 
 // or
 
 npm start
 ```
 
 ### Accessing the server and returning data
 
 The server should be running by now, and you can visit `http://localhost:3001` to see it in action. 
 
 Visit `http://localhost:3000/users` -- which will automatically issue a GET request to our running API server -- you'll see a simple JSON array populated with some dummy user data.
